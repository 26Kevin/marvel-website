    <hr />

    <p> 
      Marvel was first started in 1939 by Martin Goodman, it was first started as comics then in 2008, they started starting movies and tv shows, their first movie was Iron Man released in May 2 2008. They have made 34 MCU Movies and series. The main people at Marvel are Issac Perimutter (Chairperson), Kevin Feige(Cheif creative officer), and Dan Buckley(President). I mostly like to watch MCU movies and some tv shows.
