<h2>My Favorite Marvel Characters</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      1)Spiderman: He got bit by a radioactive spider, from the spider he got superpowers like superhuman strength, speed and agility. He is even a teenager behind the suit. I like him because I relate to him because he is a teenager, and he likes being a superhero. The movies are good as well, there are 3 francise with different actors, my favorite actor is Tom Holland, because he loves being spiderman and his favorite character is spiderman aswell.
    </p>

    <p>
      2)Iron Man: He is smart, he makes armor robots which he uses to get strength, durability, he can fly and has weapons which are in the armor. He died in Avengers Endgame by snapping the infinity gaunlet, from that he saved the entire universe from Thanos and his forces by snapping the mout of existence. But the 6 infinity stones took its toll on his body and died of his injuries. I like him because he sacrificed himself and was a great person to spiderman by making suits like his for spiderman to use.

     3) Doctor Strange: He was a skilled neurosuregeon before he damaged his hands. From that he went to an acient school and learned magic and now he is the Sorcerer Supreme and he protects Earth from magical and mystical threats.

  <li>
    Spiderman No Way Home: because all of the 3 actors were in the movie and it was pretty fun to watch it was not that long as avengers Endgame which I like because I don't get bored and tired. It got released in December 2021.
  </li>
  <li>
    Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness: I liked it because it was something new by making it some horror. And we saw how the multiverse was, which is a big part of Marvel. Because the future of their movies could be more entertaining from connecting the heros and villans from different universes in Marvel, im very excited to see the next movies and tv shows. It released in May 2022.
  </li>
  <li>
    Avengers Endgame: Because it was a really good avengers movie . They had a lot of heroes and villans, they went in the past to get the infinity stones which was fun to watch how they connected the past to the movie, it was sad aswell, because we lost three main avengers Captain America, Iron Man and Black Widow.  But it was long which I don't like.
